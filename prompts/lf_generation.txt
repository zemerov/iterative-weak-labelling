# Context

I am solving text classification task for {dataset_name} dataset via Weak Supervision. 
I have a labelling functions formulated in a form of binary criterion (value â€” True/False). 
The value for a given text and criterion is collected via few-shot-prompting LLM.
Each criteria corresponds to specific class.
Each criterion is then converted in labelling function which predict the class_name if True else ABSTAIN. 

# Task

Extract new criteria to determine the correct class of a text. 
You are given the list of existing criteria for classification and classification error for existing model. 

# Existing criteria

{existing_criteria}


# List of texts where and the correct labels

{texts_with_labels}


# Response format

List all new criteria in the response. For each, include the name, a description of the criterion, and the class to which it belongs.
The description should be clear for LLM and consist of several sentences and explain the dialogues that match this criterion.

Respond in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
[
    {"criterion": str, "description": str, "class": str},
    {"criterion": str, "description": str, "class": str},
    ...
]
```
