# Task

You will be given a dictionary of criteria and their descriptions.
Remove duplicates â€” criteria that describe the same thing.
In your response, I want to receive a list of criterion that includes only unique (non-overlapping) criteria from the original dictionary.
If all criteria in the original dictionary are different, simply copy it into the response.

# Dictionary of criteria
